# Chord progression comparison
This project is a little webapp that compares given chord progressions to
standard ones, like [I vi ii V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTz5xjmso4)
or [I V iv IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mPAO0R8uuQ). It is meant to be
used at class by my students, to facilitate harmonic analysis of popular songs.
I will be adding a 'transpose' function so that they get a chord progression in
a key given by them, so that they can use this chords for composing songs of
their own.
